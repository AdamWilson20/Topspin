# Topspin
2018-2019 Workforce development project 

 Topspin aimed to provide the ODU  tennis fans the ability to connect with players and team with an  interactive application. 
 Topspin’s primary functionality consists of  real-time scoring updates to the mobile application and website.  
 There is also a team management console that allows administrators to add or remove players from the current roster,
 and update players statistics such as win/loss record. 
 
 The main project of Topspin was developed in the Front-End Branch.
